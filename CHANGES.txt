v1.3.1 2020/06/19
- parameter to preserve cost when CFR
- new binaries of PE that allows not to unfold nodes
v1.3 2020/06/04
- non-termination reachability
- allowing C as entry
- renaming a parameter
- optimizing close walks
- sampling non-deterministic variables
- give properties of nodes through a different file
v1.2.1 2019/06/09
- variables domain via parameter
- smt2 as output format
- close walks
- analyse non determinism of close walks
v1.2 2019/01/23 (remove ppl dependency at this level)
- invariants and all node-properties are now independent from ppl.
- all the algorithms are now independent from ppl.
- minor other improvements.
- pep8.
v1.1 2018/12/19
- check assertions of cfgs and refined cfgs
- properties of projection are computed now on python side
- remove no important variables has been moved.
- partial-evaluation now can handle simple sccs calling "prepare" first.
- analyse termination and non-termination in one single call.
- three possible strategies to apply CFR. After, at scc level and Before.
- algorithm to compute nodes on the way to a set of nodes.
- 'print-graphs' argument to print the fc and svg of the cfg and their corresponding refined graphs.
